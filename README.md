## About The Project  

Instagram is one of the leading social media platforms globally, designed to connect people through photos, videos, and creative content. It offers users a seamless way to share moments, express creativity, and engage with a vibrant community.  

Instagram's vision is to foster creativity and bring people closer together by evolving its platform to meet the dynamic needs of its users.  

This project, **Instagram Micmic**, was created for school purposes by ADET students. While it does not include actual functionalities, it serves as a creative representation and design exercise, highlighting the students' ability to conceptualize and present a user interface inspired by Instagram's core elements.  

### Project Creators  
- **Erica Jieren Monacillo**  
- **Jhey Gulde**  
- **Shene Rose Suelo**  
- **Rodrigo Arriba**  
- **Jars Christian Lerio**  

The project focuses on the visual and structural aspects of Instagram, providing an opportunity for the creators to demonstrate their skills in design, layout organization, and collaborative development. It serves as an educational project aimed at understanding application design principles rather than building a fully functional application.
